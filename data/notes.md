## Data structure

the file should consist in the zip code
year,month,median_listing_price,rmse

We should have another file where we can grab the meta data information about the zipcode,
like the coordenates, name, etc...

The idea is use the index file in the search for a place, then go to the specific data with the graph.
The enough information for for getting the information is the state and zipcode.
and we can implement a fuzzy finder where it can locate the information and match with the city - state - zipcode
